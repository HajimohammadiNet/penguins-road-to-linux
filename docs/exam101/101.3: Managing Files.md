## Introduction

Linux filesystems follow a hierarchical directory structure with `/` (the root directory) at the top. Knowing how to manipulate files and directories is essential for managing data, configuring services, and maintaining overall system organization. Let’s explore the key commands and concepts step by step.

---

## Navigating Directories

### Changing Directories

- **`cd <directory>`**: Change the current directory to `<directory>`.
    ```bash
    cd /home/user/Documents
    ```
- **`cd ~`: Move to your home directory (shortcut for `/home/<username>`).**
    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

### Listing Contents

- **`ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.**
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    - **Common options:**
        - `ls -l`: Long listing format (permissions, owner, size, modification date).
        - `ls -a`: Show hidden files (files starting with a `.`).
        - `ls -lh`: Long listing with human-readable file sizes.
        - **Combine options: `ls -lah`**
            ```bash
            ls -lah
            ```

### Creating and Removing Directories

- **`mkdir <directory>`: Create a new directory.**
    ```bash
    mkdir myfolder
    ```

- **`mkdir -p <dir1/dir2/dir3>`: Create nested directories without error if they already exist.**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p project/src/main
    ```

- **`rmdir <directory>`: Remove an empty directory.**
    ```bash
    rmdir oldfolder
    ```

- **`rm -r <directory>`: Remove a directory and all its contents (be careful).**
    ```bash
    rm -r myfolder
    ```

---

## Basic File Operations

### Creating Files

- **`touch <filename>`: Create an empty file or update the timestamp if it already exists.**
    ```bash
    touch file1.txt
    ```

- **Redirect output: Create a file with content using >:**
    ```bash
    echo "Hello, world!" > file2.txt
    ```

### Copying Files

- **`cp <source> <destination>`: Copy a file or directory.**
    ```bash
    cp file1.txt backup_file1.txt
    ```

    - **Common options:**
        - `cp -r`: Recursively copy directories.
        - `cp -i`: Prompt before overwriting.
        - `cp -v`: Verbose, show what’s happening.
        ```bash
        cp -r folder1 folder1_backup
        ```

### Moving and Renaming Files

- **`mv <source> <destination>`: Move or rename a file/directory.**
    ```bash
    mv file1.txt folder1/
    mv oldname.txt newname.txt
    ```

    - **Common options:**
        - `mv -i`: Prompt before overwriting existing files.
        - `mv -v`: Verbose mode.

### Removing Files

- **rm <filename>: Remove (delete) a file permanently.**
    ```bash
    rm oldfile.txt
    ```

    - **Common options:**
        - `rm -f`: Force removal, ignore non-existent files, no prompt.
        - `rm -r`: Recursively remove directories and their contents.
        - `rm -i`: Prompt before every removal (safer).

### Linking Files
Linux supports two types of links:

1. **Hard link**: A direct reference to the same inode on disk.
    ```bash
    ln original.txt hardlink.txt
    ```
    - Both files share the same data; deleting one does not remove the other unless no other links exist.

2. **Symbolic link (soft link)**: A reference (pointer) to another file or directory path.
    ```bash
    ln -s original.txt symlink.txt
    ```
    - If the original is removed, the symlink becomes broken (dead link).

## Viewing File Contents

### cat, more, less

- **`cat <file>`: Display the entire file content to standard output.**
    ```bash
    cat file1.txt
    ```

- **`more <file>`: View file content page by page (press Space to go to next page).**
    ```bash
    more largefile.txt
    ```

- **`less <file>`: Similar to more, but allows backward scrolling with the arrow keys or b.**
    ```bash
    less verylargefile.txt
    ```

### head and tail

- **`head <file>`: Display the first 10 lines by default. Use `-n <number>` to specify how many lines.**
    ```bash
    head -n 5 file1.txt
    ```

- **`tail <file>`: Display the last 10 lines. Use `-n <number>` for more lines.**
    ```bash
    tail -n 20 file1.txt
    ```

- **Real-time updates: `tail -f <file>` to follow a log file as new lines are appended.**
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/syslog
    ```

## Finding Files

### find Command
`find` is powerful and can search based on name, type, size, modification date, and more.

- **By name:**
    ```bash
    find /path/to/search -name "*.txt"
    ```

- **Case-insensitive search:**
    ```bash
    find / -iname "readme.md"
    ```

- **By file type:**
    ```bash
    # f = regular file, d = directory, l = symbolic link
    find /home/user -type d -name "Documents"
    ```

- **By size:**
    ```bash
    # +50M means larger than 50 MB
    find / -size +50M
    ```
### Using `-exec` with find

`-exec` allows you to execute a command on each file or directory that matches your search criteria. The special placeholder `{}` represents the path of the matched file, and it must be followed by `\;` or `+` to terminate.

- **Example 1: Remove files older than 30 days**
    ```bash
    find /path/to/old_logs -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;
    ```
    - `-mtime +30` finds files older than 30 days.
    - `-exec rm {} \;` removes each matched file.

- **Example 2: Change permissions on all `.sh` scripts**
    ```bash
    find /path/to/scripts -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
    ```
    - This command finds all `.sh` files and then executes `chmod +x` on each file.

- **Example 3: Move or copy matching files**
    ```bash
    # Move all .log files to /tmp/logs
    find . -name "*.log" -exec mv {} /tmp/logs \;
    ```
    - Each file found is moved to the `/tmp/logs` directory.

**Tips: Tip: You can replace `\;` with `+` to group multiple filenames into a single command execution (when supported), which can be more efficient:**

```bash
find . -name "*.log" -exec mv {} /tmp/logs +
```

### locate Command
- **`locate <pattern>`: Uses a pre-built database to quickly find files matching `<pattern>`.**
    ```bash
    locate index.html
    ```

- **Update the database (cron job usually does this automatically):**
    ```bash
    sudo updatedb
    ```

## File Permissions and Ownership
### Understanding Permission Bits
Every file has three sets of permissions for three categories:

1. Owner (u)
2. Group (g)
3. Others (o)

Permissions are displayed as a string of 10 characters when using `ls -l`:
```bash
    -rwxr-xr--  1 user  group  1024 Jan 31 12:00 script.sh
     |   |  |
     |   |  └─ "others" permissions (r--)
     |   └──── "group" permissions (r-x)
     └──────── "owner" permissions (rwx)
```
- `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute
- The first character indicates file type (`-` for regular file, `d` for directory).

### Changing Permissions (chmod)

- **Symbolic notation (`u`, `g`, `o`):**
    ```bash
    # Add execute permission for owner
    chmod u+x script.sh

    # Remove read permission from group
    chmod g-r secrets.txt
    ```

- **Octal notation: `r=4`, `w=2`, `x=1`**
    ```bash
    # 755 = rwx for owner, r-x for group, r-x for others
    chmod 755 script.sh

    # 644 = rw- for owner, r-- for group, r-- for others
    chmod 644 file.txt
    ```

### Changing Ownership (chown, chgrp)

- **`chown <new_owner> <file>`: Change the owner of a file.**
    ```bash
    sudo chown alice file.txt
    ```

- **Also change group simultaneously:**
    ```bash
    sudo chown alice:developers projectfolder
    ```

- **`chgrp <new_group> <file>`: Change group ownership.**
    ```bash
    sudo chgrp developers projectfolder
    ```

## Practical Exercises

1. **Directory Navigation**
    
    - Create a new directory called `practice` in your home folder and navigate into it.
        ```bash
        mkdir ~/practice
        cd ~/practice
        ```

2. **File Creation and Deletion**
    
    - Create two files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` using `touch`.
        ```bash
        touch file1.txt file2.txt
        ```
    
    - Remove `file2.txt`.
        ```bash
        rm file2.txt
        ```
3. **Copying and Moving**
    
    - Make a copy of `file1.txt` named `file1_backup.txt`.
        ```bash
        cp file1.txt file1_backup.txt
        ```

    - Move `file1_backup.txt` into a new directory `backups` (first create `backups`).
        ```bash
        mkdir backups
        mv file1_backup.txt backups/
        ```

4. **Link Creation**

    - Create a symbolic link to `file1.txt` named `file1_link.txt`.
        ```bash
        ln -s file1.txt file1_link.txt
        ```

5. **Viewing File Contents**

    - Add some text to `file1.txt`:
        ```bash
        echo "This is some text." > file1.txt
        ```

    - Display it using `cat`.
        ```bash
        cat file1.txt
        ```

6. **Searching for Files**

    - Use `find` to locate `file1.txt` in the current directory.
        ```bash
        find . -name "file1.txt"
        ```

7. **Permissions and Ownership**

    - Give execute permission to `file1.txt`:
        ```bash
        chmod u+x file1.txt
        ls -l file1.txt
        ```

    - Change the owner to `root` (requires sudo) [only if you have permissions]:
        ```bash
        sudo chown root file1.txt
        ```

8. **Cleanup**

    - Remove the `practice` directory and its contents (be careful):
        ```bash
        cd ~
        rm -r practice
        ```
